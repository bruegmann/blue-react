## Developing

This project is built with [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/). To start developing, just and install everything with `npm i` and run:
```
npm start
```

## Create a new release

This is how to manually create a release:\
By running
```
npm publish --tag v6.9
```
the missing files in `./dist` will be created, the docs will be generated and the NPM package will be released.

To publish changes on the documentary, run:
```
npm run deploy
```

To run both of them:
```
npm run release
```
